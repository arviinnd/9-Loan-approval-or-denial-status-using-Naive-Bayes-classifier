Subject: Use case on loan approval or denial status using Naive Bayes classifier <br>
<br>
Respected everyone,
  The aim of this case study is to predict the loan approval or denial status of an applicant using Naive Bayes classifier. First we 
  load the dataset and the libraries into the code. Then we do data analyses like getting a peek at the data, dropping off relatively 
  less important features and describing the data, finding correlation coefficients and drawing inferences for different features. Then 
  we do data visualizations for univariate features using histogram and distibuted plot. We then split the data into training and testing 
  data. Then a model is instantiated using Gaussian Naive Bayes method and model is fitted and acuuary is found out. Our model gives an 
  accuarcy of 86 %. We also find the confusion matrix at the end. <br>

  Thanks and regards, <br>
  Yours sincerely, <br>
